# SPIRIT Project Overview

## What is SPIRIT?

SPIRIT is an **open-source smartphone project** that aims to revolutionize mobile devices by prioritizing user control, privacy, and repairability. Unlike traditional smartphones that lock users out of their own devices, SPIRIT is designed from the ground up to be completely transparent and modifiable.

## Why SPIRIT Exists

### The Problem
Modern smartphones have several fundamental issues:
- **Proprietary software** that users can't inspect or modify
- **Hardware kill switches** that don't actually cut power to components
- **Difficult to repair** designs that force users to buy new devices
- **Vendor lock-in** that limits user choice
- **Privacy concerns** with no physical way to ensure components are truly off

### The SPIRIT Solution
SPIRIT addresses these problems by providing:
- **Complete transparency** - all hardware designs and software are open source
- **Physical privacy switches** - hardware switches that physically disconnect components
- **Repairability by design** - components can be replaced and upgraded
- **Community control** - development driven by users, not corporations
- **Educational value** - learn how smartphones actually work

## Key Features

### Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5** as the core processor
- **Custom carrier board** that connects all components
- **Physical privacy switches** for mic, camera, GPS/cellular, and battery
- **Standard components** that are available from multiple suppliers
- **Modular design** allowing component upgrades and replacements

### Software
- **Pure AOSP** (Android Open Source Project) - no vendor modifications
- **Optimized for privacy** with hardware integration
- **Community-driven development** 
- **FOSS-first approach** preferring open source drivers and applications

### Documentation
- **Complete design files** including schematics, PCB layouts, and mechanical drawings
- **Build instructions** for both hardware assembly and software compilation
- **Educational materials** explaining how each component works
- **Community resources** for getting help and contributing

## Philosophy & Values

SPIRIT is built on these core principles:

### Transparency
Every aspect of SPIRIT is open and documented. There are no hidden components, proprietary drivers, or secret protocols. If it's in your device, you can understand how it works.

### User Control
You own your device and should have complete control over it. SPIRIT ensures that users, not corporations, decide what software runs and what data is shared.

### Privacy by Design
Privacy isn't an afterthought - it's built into the hardware. Physical switches provide absolute certainty that components are truly off.

### Community Driven
SPIRIT belongs to the community that builds and uses it. Decisions are made in the open with community input, not behind corporate boardroom doors.

### Repairability
Devices should last and be fixable. SPIRIT uses standard components, provides complete repair documentation, and supports user modifications.

### Education
Understanding technology empowers users. SPIRIT serves as a teaching platform for mobile technology, from basic electronics to advanced software development.
